# open-in-other-group README

A small VS Code extension that registers one command: open-in-other-group.open-in-other-group

This can be used to quickly get a second view of the file currently being edited.

If there is only one editor column open, this will open another showing the same file. If there are already 2+ columns open, then this will open the currently active file in the first column, or the column beside it.
